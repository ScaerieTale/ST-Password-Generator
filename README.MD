# Password Generator
## Code by ScaerieTale and Dr. Angela Yu
The code by Dr Yu is what will appear first in the repo, the 'setup' boilerplate.  Everything beyond that initial commit si my own work.

I'm really proud of this one because it's the first actually useful app I've designed, basically doing what BitWarden and other passord generators do, but from a CLI :)
